# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace visible “SMART JANGHAI” brand-name text with the existing logo image so the logo is the primary branding mark across the site.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the homepage hero branding to use the existing logo image asset instead of rendering “SMART JANGHAI” as visible text, ensuring only one logo mark is shown.
- Update the footer branding area to display the logo image instead of a “SMART JANGHAI” text heading.
- Preserve responsive sizing and the existing resilient image-loading/fallback behavior so missing logo assets don’t cause blank sections or runtime errors.

**User-visible outcome:** The site shows the logo image (not “SMART JANGHAI” text) as the main brand mark in the hero and footer, with responsive layout and graceful fallback if the image fails to load.
