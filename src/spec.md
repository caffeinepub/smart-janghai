# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a public, English-only informational homepage for “Smart Janghai” with a modern, cohesive theme and a branded hero section using a generated static hero image.

**Planned changes:**
- Build a responsive homepage layout with a hero section that displays “SMART JANGHAI” and a short English tagline.
- Add at least two additional informational sections below the hero (e.g., intro, highlights) plus a footer using placeholder English text.
- Create and include a generated hero image as a static asset under `frontend/public/assets/generated`, and use it as the hero’s primary visual (ensuring text contrast/readability).
- Apply a consistent modern visual theme across the page (typography, spacing, components) using a palette that is not dominated by blue and purple together.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can view a modern, responsive Smart Janghai informational homepage with a branded hero image, clear title/tagline, and additional informational sections in English.
