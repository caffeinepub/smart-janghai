  "summary": "REQ-2 and REQ-5 appear implemented via a polling LiveVotingResultsWidget and a separate ComingSoonRibbon on the homepage. REQ-1 is not met because the homepage promo title text does not exactly match the required string. REQ-3 cannot be confirmed from the truncated backend diff: votingResults storage/type is added, but the required public query and admin-only mutation methods are not shown.",

      "requirement": "Add a new promotional section at the very top of the homepage (above the existing hero section) with the exact title text: \"GRAM PRADHAN VOTING LIVE RESULT OF WHOLE VILLAGES AROUND JANGHAI COMMING SOON STAY TUNED WITH US...\"",
      "reason": "The new promo section exists, but the required title text is not an exact match; it is split into a title and a separate subtitle and also changes spelling/casing (e.g., missing \"COMMING\").",

      "reason": "Diff shows the VotingResult type and an in-memory votingResults map plus a migration adding votingResults to state, but does not show any public query method (e.g., getAllVotingResults) nor admin-only shared methods (create/update/delete) or authorization checks for these operations in backend/main.mo (file content is truncated).",
