  "summary": "REQ-20 and REQ-21 appear implemented: hero branding is logo-only, footer copyright no longer contains “Smart Janghai”, and BrandLogo now uses a non-text placeholder on image load failure. However, the diff also introduces additional footer user-facing content (Support section and caffeine.ai attribution) that was not requested and may violate the “do not rewrite beyond removing brand-name text” non-goal.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest only asks to remove visible “Smart Janghai” branding text and adjust logo fallback behavior; it explicitly states not to redesign the homepage layout or rewrite non-branding informational copy beyond removing brand-name text.",
