  "summary": "Implemented improved admin route guarding with explicit loading UI, a dedicated error view with Retry/Back-to-Home actions, and introduced a shared UserRole helper. Also added UI changes that expose role information in the dashboard navbar and (per file summary) added a Home page navigation entry to Admin Login. One key requirement—handling non-string/variant-shaped UserRole values robustly—does not appear fully addressed based on the diff evidence.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-53",
      "requirement": "Admin role check must not rely on string literal comparison and must work with the actual returned shape from generated candid types (including variant/union shapes).",
      "reason": "The new helper `isAdminRole` only checks `role === UserRole.admin`, which covers an enum-like representation but does not show handling for common candid variant object shapes (e.g., `{ admin: null }`) or other generated union representations. The diff provides no evidence of shape normalization/guards beyond enum equality.",

      "requirement": "From Admin Login, successful sign-in navigates to the Admin Dashboard and the sidebar menu with admin options is visible on desktop and accessible on mobile via the existing toggle button.",
      "reason": "No diff evidence shows updates to the Admin Login page/component to navigate to `admin-dashboard` on success, nor any changes ensuring the admin sidebar/toggle behavior. The provided changes focus on route guarding, error UI, and home-page navigation visibility.",
